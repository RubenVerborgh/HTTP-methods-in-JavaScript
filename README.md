# Modeling HTTP methods in JavaScript
## About
In the blog post
[“The object-resource impedance mismatch”](http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2012/09/27/the-object-resource-impedance-mismatch/),
I wondered what would happen
if we model the semantics of HTTP methods in JavaScript.
This is the accompanying code
that allows you to play with it.

## Usage
You need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
or a another JavaScript interpreter installed.
Then, execute this:

    node http-methods.js

Alternatively, you can just use your browser's debug window.

The output makes most sense
if you follow along with
the [source](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/HTTP-methods-in-JavaScript/blob/master/http-methods.js).
